# Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should be:

  - comfortable building simple, static web pages by writing raw HTML and CSS in a text editor;
  - familiar with the LINUX/OSX command line and able to navigate and manipulate your file system strictly through the terminal;
  - acquainted with the basics of version-control through git and github.

You don't need prior programming experience, but it helps.
This course is oriented to beginning programmers, but the less experience you come in with, the more time you'll need to commit to keep up.
It's possible to succeed with either limited availability or limited experience, but not both.

  * Articulating assertions about the pre- and post-conditions of code units
  * Anticipating sources of code failure and including reasonable safeguards
  * Generating example cases and outliers for testing code

<!--
When you hear an explanation, can you:
  apply it to a problem
  restate in own words
  generate novel examples
  distinguish the incidental details from essential ones
-->

### Communication Skills
  * Expressing your reasoning and assumptions while solving problems in real time;
  * Expressing partial understanding and paths of approach to unsolved problems;
  * Delivering effective presentations on prepared topics to an appropriate degree of detail;
  * Documenting code with an appropriate level of commentary;
  * Coding clearly and efficently so that your code is accessible even without comments;
  * Expressing design ideas though mock-ups, wireframes, storyboards, or other representations;
  * Collaborating with team members about unresolved issues and articulate the space of visible solutions;
  * Partitioning responsibilities between team members.

# Educational Expectations

## Time Commitment

In addition to the 7-8 (averaged) hours of class time each week, you should expect to spend at least 20 hours/week _outside of class_ in a combination of self-study and peer collaboration.

#### Using your time effectively

There is a wide gulf between passively absorbing information, even actual code, and actively generating it.
Generation, of both code and intermediate products, is far more difficult and more important.

Up to 20% of your time could reasonably be spent in a largely passive mode, absorbing information: reading about Javascript and related tools, watching tutorials, listening to someone else's explanations.

But least 80% of your time should be in production mode, in active generation of intellectual work.  This could include:

-   Actually typing code;
-   Testing code fragments and expressions in a JS console, making and verifying predictions;
-   Articulating pseudo-code, verbal descriptions of data structures and processes needed to manipulate them;
-   Sketching diagrams on paper to represent data or processes or to trace the execution of code samples;
-   Participating actively in conversation about specific problems; 
-   Articulating and writing down questions when you discover gaps in your understanding;
-   Searching online for the answers to specific questions, and revising your inquiry as you proceed;
-   Explaining a concept or algorithm to a classmate.

As a general rule, within every hour of work you should generate some kind of physical or digital trail: a few lines of code, a diagram, a list of vocabulary, some written sentences describing what you've learned.

If you're not regularly generating artifacts, and relentlessly exposing confusion by making errors, you're fooling yourself about how much you understand.

#### Homework

Weekly homework assignments are the backbone of this course; they will help you structure your efforts and ensure practice of the most important skills.
The homework problems will often be difficult; they are meant to exercise you until it hurts.  We don't expect you to solve them all, but make your best effort;  your growth will be proportional to the number of problems you wrestle with.

#### Exploration

Although the homework probelms are important and demanding, don't become fixated on solving them to the exclusion of making discoveries.  Some of your time each week should be spent in active play:
- changing a problem in way you find interesting;
- discovering a new function or feature of JS and testing out how it works;
- forming a hypothesis about the behavior of some code, or unusual inputs to code, and doing experiments to test your prediction;
- finding a sample of code unrelated to class and figuring out how it works.

In short, explore: push all the buttons, turn all the knobs, take everything apart and poke the pieces, and put them back together in ridiculous ways.

#### Tracking your time

You should create a free account with Harvest or another time-tracking service and log all of the hours you spend related to the class.  Try to describe your activity in sufficient detail that, when you review your log after a week or month, you can draw useful lessons about your time-management.


## Assessment Methods

You will not receive a grade.  Your trophy will be the skills you build, and it's your responsibility to keep focused on that goal.  But an inevitable secondary product is the impression you leave on your instructors and peers.

At the end of each term, employers ask us for recommendations -- the names of particularly talented and hard-working students.  We want you to do well, and want to recommend you.  And we have greater confidence in making endorsements when a trail of evidence of your participation supports our subjective impression. 

All of these sources contribute to our evaluation of your progress and readiness:

  1. **Homework:**
The code and work products you submit will be evaluated by at least two people: you yourself and at least one TA or instructor.  Each problem section will receive a score from 0-4, following a rubric which will be shared openly and re-negotiated as needed.  The weekly details of your scores will have little significance, except for two worrisome patterns:
* consistent differences (in either direction) between your self-evaluations and your mentor's evaluation are a sign that you don't recognize what constitutes code quality;
* low scores (0 or 1) are a sign that either you're not managing your time or you're not connecting with others to get yourself unstuck.

  1. **Weekly Invoices:**
  Life is busy, and you can have some distracted weeks, but if you have consistently low hours per week (or consistently fail to submit data!), your confusions will be met with less sympathy.  And if your reported time spent is higher than your apparent progress, we'll wonder how efficiently your using your time.

  1. **Midterm Conferences:**
  In Week 9 or 10 you'll need to schedule a time for a 30 minute conversation with your instructor about your progress and concerns.  It will not be a technical interview, but you will be expected to offer a realistic and candid summary of your progress and proposals to redress any trends of failure.

  1. **Participation in Class and Office Hours:**
  The ability to formulate questions even in the fog of confusion is a critical skill.  No one is counting the number of questions you ask in class or scoring your success on in-class exercises, but a pattern of passivity will raise concerns and stunt your growth.  
 
  1. **Practice talks, whiteboarding, and mock interviews:**
  In later weeks especially, these activites can be a chance to show some skill which other measures have missed.

  1. **Capstone Groups:**
  Starting in week 12, your instructor will organize you (with your input) into groups of 3-4 for your Capstone projects.  Most of your activity in weeks 12-16 will be with your group, and you will succeed or flail together.  Each week, your group will have a "stand-up" meeting with the instructor to report on your progress, obstacles, and individual roles.  In this phase, teamwork is as important as individual skill, and people who might have been struggling in isolation will be re-evaluated in regard to their collaborative skills.

  1. **Capstone Presentations:**
  The last evening of the class will be a public open-house in which Capstone groups show off their work to visitors including potential employers.  That event is a chance to impress peers and future colleagues without regard to any bumps in the road beforehand.

<!--
The primary purpose of each component is to help you.
But a second product is for your Instuctor and TAs to develop a sense of your skills.
You should never let the latter interfere with the former.  For example, if you are confused by something you think you should understand already, you might feel some embarrassment in asking questions about it.  You might decide to cover up your confusion so as not to erode your instructor's impression.  But in doing so, you will sabotage your own forward progress, and in the end your instructors and peers will see your inability to participate in solving problems.
