### Installation
- Linux: See https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages
- OSX: See Jekyll Docs
- Windows: good luck (See http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/)

### Development
* Jekyll Development Commands
    - prefix commands with `bundle exec`
        + Example: `bundle exec jekyll server --watch`
    - besides the need to prefix with `bundle exec`, you can rely upon Jekyll documentation
* There is no need to edit anything in _site folder. You may want to view files in that folder from time to time if you are not sure if your development files rendered. Other than that, it is simply some output that Jekyll creates.
