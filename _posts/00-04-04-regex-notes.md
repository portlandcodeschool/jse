We've reached a turning point in the class here.

This is the first time that we're just pointing to resources for them to go
learn on their own.

We've coupled this with an ongoing assignment.

This is as real world as it gets. The students will have to determine on their
own how to prioritize their time. We should encourage them to work on
understanding the principles of regular expressions, how and how they'll
increase their productivity.

Suggested initial time investment: 4 hours. They could split that over two
days.
