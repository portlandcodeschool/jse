Today we're going to build a front-end app that interacts with a REST API.
You'll use the [Foursquare API][foursquare-api] to build a site for finding an
awesome lunch place.

## Challenge

Build a front-end web app that connects to the Foursquare API and chooses one
random location for lunch.

### Extras

- Use HTML5's geolocation so you don't have to specify a location
- Add a Google map to the result
- Display an image of the lunch spot
- Allow the user to exclude results and run it again
- Save the results from Foursquare as well as any exclusions from the user so
  that the user doesn't have to wait as long when they return the next time
- Have the user authenticate with Foursquare, so the results are personalized
