## Class Flow


- Do the `learnyounode` tutorial, get as far as possible before lunch. The
  following exercises should be repeats `hello world`, `baby steps`,
  `my first i/o!`, `my first async i/o!`, `filtered ls`, and `make it modular`.
  It'll be best for them to pick 2 or three of those, then skip over to the
  HTTP stuff.
  - `http client` should be relatively straight forward.
  - `http collect` introduces event emitters.
  - `juggling async` will probably be difficult.
  - `time server` starts to introduce network servers.
  - `http file server` will be something we build off of.
  - `http uppercaserer` and `http json api server` are good network exercises
    as well.

- Have students discuss/present where they had troubles with the tutorial, what
  they learned, and what they didn't grasp.

- After lunch, start building up a server. Use TDD while doing this. The
  students can (and should) try to do this on their own, but it will likely be
  something where we do a little together, then they do a little repeating on
  their own. The server will handle the following things that `express` does
  well:
  - Routing, GET, POST, DELETE, PUT (and parameters in routes, `req.params`)
  - Return proper content type: HTML, JSON
  - Parsing GET queries (`req.query`),  & POST body (`req.body`)
  - Simple lookup of all input (`req.param()`)
  - Redirects

- TDD for the server will include:
  - Using an HTTP client to issue requests.
  - Testing responses (including body & headers).
  - Including a `fixtures` directory for pages being served.
  - Including an `expected` directory for the bodies of responses.
  - Splitting the API logic out into _controller_ like modules so they can be
    tested without issuing requests.
  - Could add a `storage` type object that holds all of the people and use
    _stubs_ to ensure that the storage methods get called during testing of the
    api logic (disadvantage: throwing tons of stuff at them all at once). Or
    could just expose the storage object to the tests (disadvantage: exposing
    internals to tests). Or could simply call another method afterwards
    (disadvantage: not testing in isolation). Choose one of these based on
    where the class seems to be.
