It's time to learn more Ember!

If you haven't already started looking into objects/models and controllers,
try to get through those two topics today.

As you look in to objects, you'll find the word model used as well. Ember has
advanced modeling capabilities via Ember Data, but you'll probably want to
leave that for later.

Make sure you can answer the following questions:

- How do you create a new class (or subclass) with Ember?
- How do you instantiate objects?
- What is the purpose of controllers?
- What is the relationship between routes, models, and controllers?
- What do `get` and `set` do in Ember?
- What is a property?
- What is a computed property?
- How can you observe changes to an object?
- How do actions work?
- How do you access associated models, routes, and controllers from one
  another?
- How do you access them from other routes/views controllers?
- How do you handle errors?

You should be able to:

- React to the user clicking on things.
- React to a change of a property on an object/model.
- Create a complex application with many routes and controllers.
- Build a pretty sweet little application that connects to an API (either yours
  or an external API).
