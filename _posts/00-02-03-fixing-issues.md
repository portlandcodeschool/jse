As you may have noticed, the JSI Game Library has some
[issues][github-jsi-game-library-issues].

Today you'll fix each of those issues.

## Debugging

In addition to simply using `console.log` as a debugging tool, Node has a full
[debugger][node-debugger] that you can use.

Let's take a look. Try it out while you work on this, but a combination of
using `console.log` and the debugger will work well.


## Challenges

- Enhance the grid display so that you can specify which rooms to show. Alter
  your game so that as you play, you can also see a map of the rooms you've
  already visited (but not the ones you haven't).
- **Advanced:** Allow map cells to have names of any length (or newlines).
