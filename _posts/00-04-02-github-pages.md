Today we're going to publish something very basic to
[GitHub pages][github-pages]. We'll optionally set up a domain name via
[name.com][name] to work with the site.

After we've done this, you should update the site to be your portfolio site
that you just built, then continue working on the static site generator.

[github-pages]: https://pages.github.com
[name]: https://www.name.com/
