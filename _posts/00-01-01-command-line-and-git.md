### Welcome to PCS, now it's time for git

Welcome to Git. You will be using it heavily in your PCS course. If you haven't already, please create a github account. Github is sort of like a social network, cloud storage, and collaboration tool for developers. 

Setup and instructions for the git workflow for this class are located in the slides for this lesson. Be sure to take the instructions step by step. Each step is important. Don't hesitate to ask someone for help if you don't get something.
