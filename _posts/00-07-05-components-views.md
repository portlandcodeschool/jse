It's time to learn more Ember!

If you haven't already started looking into components and views, take a look
today.

Make sure you can answer the following questions:

- What's the difference between a component and a view?
- When would you want to use a component or view?
- Are there any special naming conventions for a component?
- How do you pass data to components?
- How do you create components with custom HTML?
- How do actions work with components?

You should be able to:

- Create all kinds of components. :)
