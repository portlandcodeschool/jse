Today we're going to put our applications up on Heroku.

    brew install heroku

Heroku allows us to easily deploy our applications and not have to worry too
much about creating a production environment. It also simplifies deployment
significantly. Simply `git push` and your app will be updated! It's free to get
started. Their pitch is easy scalability, but it certainly comes at a price.

A concrete example is [available][jsi-heroku-example], but Heroku has a great
guide for [setting up Node.js][heroku-node]. They also have good documentation
for getting [Postgres][heroku-postgres] set up on their platform.


## Challenge

- Follow [the instructions][jsi-heroku-example] on the example to deploy a
  pre-defined app.
- Deploy one of the apps that you've worked on that work with Bookshelf.js and
  Express.
