## Class Flow

- Run through slides
- Discuss loops as you go, allow them to give them a try
- Mention that what they've been doing is called recursion.
  Possibly explain what a base case is in recursion.

## More Problem Ideas

In case people need a challenge for the weekend, in case we decide to just go
with a few more problems, here are some ideas:

- Pig Latin translator & reverse translator

- Write a game like minesweeper.  
  Example interface:

        ./minesweep --board 1 --bombs 2 0,0
