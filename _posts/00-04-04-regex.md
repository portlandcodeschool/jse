Regular expressions are one of the most useful tools you'll add to your
toolbelt. They allow you to search for patterns in text and operate on the
search results.

Unfortunately, they're cryptic. They require you to invest some time learning
how to use them before you get any sort of productivity payoff.

Once you master them, you'll find them infinitely useful and wish that every
application that you used supported search via regular expressions.

## Resources

These resources are presented in no particular order. You will certainly have
some questions when you start digging into this material.

A learning tip: you will not learn regular expressions simply by reading about
them. You'll have to try them out and come up with ways to use them.

- [MDN on Regular Expressions][mdn-regex]
- [Wikipedia on Regular Expressions][wiki-regex]
- [Display Regualr Expressions][regexper]
- [Regex Tester][regexpal]
- [RegexOne][regex-one]  
  A site that teaches regular expressions and gives small tests during the
  learning process.
- [Regular Expression Tutorial][regex-dot-info]  
  This site has been around for a while and is still a good tutorial. You can
  use Sublime Text to test your regular expressions.
- [Learn regular expressions in about 55 minutes][regex-in-55]  
  This site aims to introduce regular expressions quickly.

Challenges like [Regex Golf][regex-golf] and [Regex Tuesday][regex-tuesday]
are a great ways to test your knowledge and improve your skills. These quickly
get hard, so you'll want to hold off until you're needing a challenge.


## Mastering Regular Expressions

Remember when you first learned to type? You probably typed via
[hunt and peck][hunt-and-peck] until someone told you to stop that. (Are you
still a hunt and peck typer? _Stop that!_) It was hard at first. You made
mistakes, and you were slower. You really wanted to go back to your old ways.
But eventually you were far more productive, right?

Do the same with regular expressions. When you're in your using your text
editor and realize that you're searching for something that a regex could make
easier, write the regex. It may take you twice as long, but every one you write
will make you better.

Eventually, you'll be able to save the day with your new found knowledge.
