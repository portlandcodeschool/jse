It's important to make sure that everyone understands that they'll never
accomplish this goal if they simply read Ember's documentation. Before everyone
goes off on their own, really make sure that's clear.

Also, discussion and asking questions is vital. Ensure that they know that they
haven't been left on their own. This is simply part of the course. They
shouldn't go more than 10 minutes without talking to their group members. If
they want to go off and research individually, then should make sure that they
all have a goal & that they'll circle back around to discuss what they
researched after a set amount of time.
