## Project Extras

If you finish this project before the end of the week, try tackling one or more
of these advanced features.

### Configurable Layouts

Allow each page on your site to specify which layout it wants to use rather
than using one global layout.

### Markdown

Markdown is a wonderful _markup language_ for writing content for web pages.
It allows you to easily skip HTML tags in favor of a syntax that's slightly
more human-readable. Lots of sites use Markdown, and it's valuable to know.
GitHub, for example, allows Markdown to be used in README files as well as in
comments.

Here's an example of the syntax:

    # Markdown Overview

    The line with _Markdown Overview_ in it will be an `h1`
    element. Using multiple `#` signs will make it lower
    level headings. You can also do things like `code`,
    **bold**, and _italic_ easily.

    This is a new paragraph because there is a blank line
    in between it and the previous paragraph.
    It
    doesn't matter how short a line is, it will be part of
    this paragraph.

    It's also easy to point you to
    [cool websites](http://www.portlandcodeschool.com).

    ## More Syntax

    It's also easy to make lists:

     * List
     * Of
     * Unordered
     * Items

    And numbered lists, too:

     1. Do
     1. In
     1. This
     1. Order

    Finally, you can do large chunks of code:

        var explain = function() {
          console.log(
            "This is a code block because " +
            "it's indented more.");
        };
        explain();

### Sass

[Sass][sass] makes CSS a lot easier to work with. Learn a little about Sass
and make your generator handle sass files.


### Watch Mode

Make you generator accept a flag that will keep it watching all files for
changes. When it notices a change, it should re-generate the output for that
file.


### Jekyll

Add some of the features that [Jekyll][jekyll] has to your generator. If you
want to be really ambitious, you can try to make your generator a drop-in
replacement for Jekyll. But be warned, this could take you months to complete!

### GitHub Pages Integration

Determine a good way to make your generator work more seamlessly with GitHub
pages. Before you implement your ideas, discuss them with your instructor to
make sure you're heading down the right path.
