-   What is JavaScript
    -   Programming language
    -   A program is like a recipe or directions
    -   Computers need every detail spelled out
    -   A programming language is
        -   A way to give instructions to a computer

-   What makes Javascript special?
    -   It was essentially **designed** for interacting with the browser
        -   Only more recently has it become useful for server-side programming
    -   All browsers have settle on Javascript as the language that they use for dynamic web pages
        -   In order for a programming language to be used in client side programming, the browser has to support it
-   Demonstrate console

    -   Demonstrate good and bad strings
    -   Why are strings necessary?
        -   Communicating with programs
        -   Storing textual data
    -   String concatenation
-   `undefined`
    -   evaluates to itself
    -   signifies that something **doesn&rsquo;t** have a value

-   Do in-class exercise 1
-   Do in-class exercise 2
-   Running whole programs in Scratchpad
-   Sequencing code with `;`
-   `console.log`
-   Statements vs. expressions
    -   expressions return values
    -   statements don&rsquo;t
        -   statements generally handle flow of program
-   What&rsquo;s a variable?
    -   A **container** for data
    -   Variable declaration statement
    -   Variable assignment expression
