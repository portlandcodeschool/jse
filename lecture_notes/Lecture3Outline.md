-   Arrays
    -   Arrays are for storing variable amounts of data
    -   Lists-of-things
        -   grocery lists
        -   to-do lists
        -   lists of addresses
        -   lists of all tweets
    -   Creating arrays
        -   Just show [] syntax, no need to actually show `new Array()` except possibly as a cutesy example later
        -   Emphasize that not all elements need to be the same
    -   `.length`, useful for performing operations on arrays
        -   ask them to suspend disbelief on `.` for a bit longer
    -   operations on arrays
        -   push
        -   pop
        -   shift
        -   unshift
        -   concat
        -   slice
-   Exercise 1
-   Iterating over arrays
    -   Do **something** for each element
        -   Show example programs using traditional for-loop
        -   Not doing for-in since it&rsquo;s considered non-idiomatic for arrays
            -   Apparently it&rsquo;s not required to traverse indexes in numerically consistent order
-   Exercise 2
-   Functions
    -   A function is the internalization of &ldquo;program&rdquo;
        -   Code that can be packaged up and run at any time
        -   Code that you can pass to other parts of your code
            -   Lego blocks
            -   Things fitting together in a modular way
    -   Creating functions
        -   Function creation through expression
        -   Function declaration as a statement
    -   Applying functions
    -   Evaluating function application
        -   Functions create their own scope
        -   Substitution of arguments
            -   `undefined` is substituted for any argument that doesn&rsquo;t have a value provided
            -   more arguments can be substituted without causing an error
    -   Functions can be passed to other functions
        -   Higher-order functions are very modular
            -   Allow greater code reuse and composition
        -   Include examples of higher-order functions 
            -   A function that repeats its first argument n-times
-   Exercise 3
-   Iteration over arrays **again**
    -   forEach
        -   show how different sets of arguments for the function have different semantics
            -   `function (currVal) ...`
            -   `function (currVal,ix) ...`
            -   `function (currVal, ix, parentArray) ...`
    -   filter
        -   lets us return a new array that has **only** the valid items in it
    -   map
        -   a common pattern
            -   do **something** for every item in the array and return a new array
                -   capitalize words
                -   strip out the part that comes after the @ in every email address
                -   send an email to every email address and return confirmation that it was sent
    -   Patterns of iteration that all demonstrate higher-order functions as modular programming
-   Exercise 4
