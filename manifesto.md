#### Allocating your time

There is a wide gulf between the passively absorbing information, even actual code, and actively generating it.

Generating solutions, both code and intermediate products, is far more difficult and more important.

Up to 20% of your time could reasonably be spent in a largely passive mode, absorbing information: reading about JS, watching tutorials, listening to someone else's explanations.

But least 80% of your time should be in production, active generation of intellectual work.

   Writing actual code, but also:
   Testing code fragments and expressions in a JS console;
   Articulating pseudo-code, verbal descriptions of data structures and the processes needed to manipulate them.
   Sketching diagrams on paper to represent data or processes, or to trace the execution of code samples.
   Participating actively in conversation, 
   Articulating and writing down questions when you discover gaps in your understanding.
   Searching online for the answers to specific questions, and revising your inquiry as you improve your understanding.
   Explaining a concept or algorithm to a classmate.

As a general rule, within every hour of work you should generate some kind of physical or digital trail: a few lines of code, a diagram, a list of vocabulary, some written sentences describing what you've learned.

#### Homework

The homework problems will be difficult; they are meant to stretch you until it hurts.  Don't consider yourself a failure if you can't solve them all, but make a serious effort.  They are designed to exercise concepts and tools which you will rely on.

But don't become fixated on solving a problem to the exclusion of making discoveries.  Some of your time each week should be spent in active play:
 changing a problem in an interesting way;
 discovering a new function or feature of JS and testing out how it works;
 forming a hypothesis about the behavior of some code, or unusual inputs to code, and doing experiments to test your prediction;

In short: push all the buttons, turn all the knobs, take everything apart and poke the pieces, and put them back together in ridiculous ways.


#### Using your time effectively


#### Tracking your time

You should create a free account with Harvest or another time-tracking service and log all of the hours you spend related to the class.  Try to describe your activity in sufficient detail that, when you review your log after a week or month, you can draw useful lessons about your time-management.



# How to succeed at this class
<!--
Our ultimate goal is to be able to give a shining recommendation about you to any and all possible employers. Over the years, Al has managed and hired many software engineers at both a junior and senior level. Our goal for you is that we would want to hire you ourselves.


Along the way, we will be asking ourselves the same questions about you that all hiring managers will be asking about you:

    Can you work in a team?
    Can you handle jobs on your own?
    Can you communicate in such a way that the people you deal with find you reliable?
    Can you find effective decisions, not just the "right" ones?
    Can you follow instructions and finish assignments ahead of schedule?
    Can you extrapolate from vague inputs and take the initiative to resolve any missing information?
    Do you have a bias towards action and taking risks?
    Can you manage your use of your own time?
    Can you deliver in a team context?
    Do you have effective learning strategies?
    Can you use testing techniques?
    Do you write valid code?
    Can you effectively code the front end of a modern, responsive web application?

Notice that the soft skills are at the top of the list and the programming skills are at the bottom. We will talk more about this in class.

When you hear an explanation, can you:
  apply it to a problem
  restate in own words
  generate novel examples
  distinguish the incidental details from essential ones


## Assessment Methods

You will not receive a grade.  The (dominant) prize will be the skills you take away, and it's your responsibility to keep focus on that goal.  But an inevitable secondary product is the impression you leave on your instructors and peers.  We

All of these sources contribute to our impression of your progress:

  1. Homework: 
the code and work products you submit will be evaluated by at least two people: you yourself and at least one TA or instructor.  Each problem section will receive a score from 0-4, following a rubric which will be shared openly and re-negotiated as needed.  The weekly details of your scores will have little significant, except for two worrisome patterns:
* consistent differences (in either direction) between your self-evaluations and the expert's evaluation are a sign that you don't recognize what constitutes code quality;
* low scores (0 or 1) are a sign that either you're not managing your time or you're not connecting with others to get yourself unstuck.

  Weekly invoices: life is busy, and you can have some off-weeks, but if you have consistently low hours per week (or fail to submit data!) your confusions will be met with less sympathy.  And if your reported time spent is higher than your apparent progress, we'll wonder how efficiently your using your time.

  Midterm Conferences: in Week 9 or 10 you'll need to schedule a time for a 20-30 minute conversation with your instructor about your progress and concerns.  It will not be a technical exam, but you will be expected to offer a realistic and candid summary of your progress and proposals to redress any trends of failure.

  Class Participation: no one is counting the number of questions you ask in class or scoring your success on in-class exercises, but a pattern of passivity willl raise concerns and stunt your growth.

  Practice talks, whiteboarding, and mock interviews: in later weeks especially, these activites can be a chance to show some skill which other measures have missed.

  Office Hours:  it's ok to be chronically confused, but not to be confused and passive.  If you're not seeking help when you need it, 
  
  Community Participation:
  	   Slack
	   Meetups


The primary purpose of each component is to help you.
But a second product is for your Instuctor and TAs to develop a sense of your skills.
You should never let the latter interfere with the former.  For example, if you are confused by something you think you should understand already, you might feel some embarrassment in asking questions about it.  You might decide to cover up your confusion so as not to erode your instructor's impression.  But in doing so, you will sabotage your own forward progress, and in the end your instructors and peers will see your inability to participate in solving problems.


We want you to do well, and want to recommend you to employers.  And we have greater confidence in making positive recommendations when the objective data supports our subjective impression.  When we see a trail of evidence of your participation

<!--
Your progress will be assessed using a variety of methods:

    Attendance - You need to show up and do the work
    Completion of assignments - we will keep track of whether you do what we ask you to do
    Code reviews - we will read and assess your code
    Quizzes - we will ask you questions and evaluate your answers
    Instructor reviews - your instructor will observe your work and take notes
    Peer reviews - we'll talk to everybody in the class to see how folks are doing on teamwork and partnering
    Participation in the community - we will ask you to hang out with your peers, meet people, and report back
    Portfolio web site - we will help you design and build a portfolio web site where you can show off your work and abilities

We will keep records of your progress. Your records are private to you and your instructor. However, at the end of the session, employers ask us for recommendations -- the names of particularly talented and hard-working students. We use student scores and evaluations to identify students for these recommendations.

We will check-in 1-on-1 with you every two weeks. You will get early notice if you need to step up your game in any particular area. After that, if in our judgment we think you still aren't able to complete the demands of the course and become a viable front end developer, we will discuss alternatives with you that may include termination of your contract with Portland Code School. For your part, if you feel you are not getting your money's worth, you can terminate your contract at any time. Check your student contract for details.

Don't worry: every two weeks, you also get to evaluate us. Fair is fair, after all. We practice agile methods here which means we do regular retrospectives and make improvements.
