  <p>This class will cover some of the fundamentals of JavaScript. We will discuss
conditionals, objects, arrays and functions. We&#39;ll also make a lot of mistakes
so we can learn that it&#39;s not quite so bad.</p>

<p>Since we&#39;re just starting off, let&#39;s take baby steps to build up our programming
chops. First, we&#39;ll learn to speak. Then we&#39;ll learn to count.</p>

<h2>Objects</h2>

<p>For quick reference, here&#39;s an example of creating and using objects:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var person = {
  name: &quot;Whitney&quot;,
  age: 4,
  favoriteColor: &quot;blue&quot;,
  hobby: &quot;cooking&quot;
};
person.age = 12;
person[&#39;favoriteColor&#39;] = &quot;orange&quot;;
console.log(person.name);</code></pre></div>

<p>We&#39;ll be exploring objects in a lot more detail in the future, but for now we&#39;ll
start using them to get comfortable with the syntax.</p>

<h2>Code Quality</h2>

<p>Are you typing everything right? Are you sure you didn&#39;t make any typos?</p>

<p>Most JavaScript programmers aren&#39;t really sure that they got it all right, so
we use programs to verify that everything looks okay. Try it out. Don&#39;t be
surprised if you have a few mistakes already. :)</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">npm install -g jshint
jshint myfile.js</code></pre></div>

<h2>Learning to Speak</h2>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>Functions are chunks of code that can be reused. Functions are just
expressions just like <code>2 + 2</code> or <code>&quot;hello world&quot;</code>.
A function expression looks like: <code>function() { /* code */ }</code>.
Usually, you&#39;ll assign functions to variables to use them. Here&#39;s a basic function
that takes no <em>arguments</em> that we&#39;ve named <code>greet</code> by assigning
it to a variable:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var greet = function() {
  console.log(&quot;Whitney says \&quot;Hello!\&quot;&quot;);
};</code></pre></div>

<p>We can then have this chunk of code run anywhere by <em>calling</em> the function.
This is done by adding <code>()</code> after the name we gave it:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">greet();</code></pre></div>

<p>Functions can also be thought of as the building blocks of programs.
Soon we&#39;ll start combining functions to make cool things happen.</p>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>Since greeting is something that many people can do, we can make
our function more general by providing it with some information.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var greet = function(personName) {
  console.log(personName + &quot; says &#39;Hello!&#39;&quot;);
};
var personName = &quot;Whitney&quot;;
greet(personName);
greet(&quot;Sara&quot;);</code></pre></div>

<p>You could also pass objects to functions:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var greet = function(person) {
  console.log(person.name + &quot; says &#39;Hello!&#39;&quot;);
};
var person = { name: &quot;Whitney&quot; };
greet(person);
greet({ name: &quot;Sara&quot; });</code></pre></div>

<h3>Return values</h3>

<p>Functions can also produce a result. We&#39;ll only touch on this briefly today, but
it will be an important concept that we start using very soon.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var person = {
  firstName: &quot;Whitney&quot;,
  lastName: &quot;Young&quot;
};

var fullName = function(person) {
  return person.fristName + &quot; &quot; + person.lastName;
};

console.log(fullName(person));</code></pre></div>

<p><aside>
<strong>Confused by parenthesis?</strong></p>

<p>When you&#39;re new to functions, the syntax can feel confusing, specifically the
parenthesis. You use them both when you&#39;re defining your function, but also when
calling the function. This really boils down to the syntax of programming languages.
Generally it&#39;s best just to accept it and move on.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re still having trouble, and you&#39;re not in the mood to just accept it, this
may help: the parenthesis don&#39;t mean just one thing. When parenthesis come after the
keyword <code>function</code>, they are being used to define arguments. When they come after a
variable name, they mean call the function. So <code>function(a, b, c)</code> means define the
arguments <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> for a new function. But <code>learnJavaScript(x, y, z)</code> means
that you want to call the function that&#39;s been assigned to <code>learnJavaScript</code> with
whatever values are in <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>.
</aside></p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<ul>
<li>Write a function that takes two arguments, both numbers, and logs the sum. For instance,
<code>sum(7, 5)</code> should log <code>The sum of 7 and 5 is 12</code>.</li>
<li>Write a function that subtracts two numbers. For instance, <code>difference(7, 5)</code> should log
<code>The difference between 7 and 5 is 2</code>.</li>
<li>Write a function that takes two people objects and logs a message about them meeting
each other for the first time. For instance, <code>introduce(john, sara)</code> would log something
like <code>John met Sara and said the color is green is awesome</code>.</li>
<li>Create variations of your sum and difference functions that return a results instead of
logging</li>
<li>Bonus: Change <code>difference</code> so that it never returns negative numbers. For instance,
both <code>difference(5, 7)</code> and <code>difference(7, 5)</code> should return <code>2</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stepping Through Execution</h3>

<p>Often it&#39;s helpful to walk through pieces of code step by step, the same way
the computer is working through it. You&#39;ll find that you can sometimes better
understand what&#39;s happening this way, and also may discover solutions to
problems in your code.</p>

<p>There are two nifty utilities that try to make this process more visual:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://int3.github.io/metajs/">metajs</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning to Count</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s go back to the early days of childhood. At some point we learned to count. Many of us
decided after we learned, that we&#39;d continue counting until we couldn&#39;t go any higher. It
was fun. We&#39;re going to try to re-create that fun time counting with a program.</p>

<p><aside class="objective">
<strong>Learning to Count Objective</strong>
Build a program where once you instruct the computer to begin counting, it will continue
counting (forever) just like a young child.
</aside></p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with a very basic function:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var sayNumber = function(n) {
  console.log(&quot;Whitney says &#39;&quot; + n.toString() + &quot;&#39;&quot;);
};</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we can speak numbers:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">sayNumber(0);
sayNumber(1);
sayNumber(2);</code></pre></div>

<p>But this doesn&#39;t really achieve the goal. We can manually give instructions to count, but we want to
have the computer automatically continue for us once we start. Let&#39;s write a function to start counting:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var startCounting = function() {
  sayNumber(0);
};</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we can start counting:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">startCounting();</code></pre></div>

<p>But at this point, we only say the number zero. So we haven&#39;t done much better. Let&#39;s add another function
to the mix to continue counting, and update our start counting function.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var startCounting = function() {
  sayNumber(0);
  continueCounting(1);
};

var continueCounting = function(n) {
  // think about what continue counting means. it means
  // that we say a number, and then continue with the
  // next number, right? do we have all the functions
  // we need in order to say a number and continue counting?
  // also, what is the next number?
};</code></pre></div>

<h3>Stopping</h3>

<p>Well, we have to stop at some point, we can&#39;t go forever.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s try to stop at 10 for now. Before we do that, we need to add <em>conditionals</em>
to our JavaScript repertoire. These are pretty easy, let&#39;s take a look:</p>

<h3>Conditionals</h3>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">if (2 &gt; 1) {
  console.log(&#39;JavaScript understands how to compare numbers.&#39;);
}

if (1 &gt; 2) {
  console.log(&#39;JavaScript failed us, and pigs are probably flying as well!&#39;);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>While we&#39;re at it, let&#39;s look at a few other things you can do with <code>if</code> statements.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var name = &quot;Whitney&quot;;
if (name === &quot;Whitney&quot;) {
  console.log(&quot;Seems like a pretty cool guy, you should talk to him.&quot;);
}
else {
  console.log(&quot;I don&#39;t know that person. Don&#39;t talk to strangers.&quot;);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>You can expand and use multiple else items:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">if (name === &quot;Whitney&quot;) {
  console.log(&quot;Seems like a pretty cool guy, you should talk to him.&quot;);
}
else if (name === &quot;Alex&quot;) {
  console.log(&quot;Oh, don&#39;t talk to him. I hate him.&quot;);
}
else {
  console.log(&quot;I don&#39;t know that person. Don&#39;t talk to strangers.&quot;);
}</code></pre></div>

<h4>Quick Status Check</h4>

<ul>
<li>Write a function that takes a person&#39;s name as an argument, and logs
a message if they are enrolled in this class. If they&#39;re not in the
class, it should log a message stating that they&#39;re not.</li>
<li>Bonus: who can get everyone&#39;s name right?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Back to Stopping</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s review our counting code again and make some changes so we only count to 10:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var continueCounting = function(n) {
  // when do we want to continue?
};</code></pre></div>

<p><aside>
The original version of the counting functions that we wrote was supposed to continue on
it&#39;s own <q>forever</q>, but it instead crashed. We hit a limitation of the current version
of JavaScript. This will be addressed in ES6, and if you&#39;d like to learn more about this,
ask in a week or two and we can discuss it more.
</aside></p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>

<p>Update the functions above so that they can be used for any person.
Hint: All of the functions will need to take another argument.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">startCounting({ name: &quot;Whitney&quot; });</code></pre></div>

<p>Bonus: Make it so 3 year olds can count to 10, 4 year olds to 20,
and everyone else to 100 (adults get bored and stop).</p>

<h2>Collections of Things (Arrays)</h2>

<p>I like fruit. Who doesn&#39;t like fruit? It&#39;s good for you and delicious.
Let&#39;s say I need an application to keep track of my fruit purchasing.
I&#39;d like to be able to ask it what I need to purchase, then when I
go to the grocery store, I&#39;d like to be able to tell it that I purchased
everything.</p>

<p>Where do I store this collection of fruit? In something called an array.
You use brackets <code>[]</code> to create arrays. Here&#39;s a basic array:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var fruits = [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;];</code></pre></div>

<p>Ok, how do I access items in this array? You access them by <em>index</em>.
An array of three items, like the one above, will have 3 slots in which
it&#39;s holding values. The indexes for these slots are <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>2</code>.
<em>What? Why not 1, 2, and 3?</em> In most programming languages, counting
starts at zero. We just get have to deal with it.</p>

<p>To access a slot, you use the brackets as well:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">console.log(fruits[0]);
console.log(fruits[1]);
console.log(fruits[2]);</code></pre></div>

<p><aside>
<strong>Confused by brackets?</strong></p>

<p>Like before with arrays, we&#39;re seeing the brackets used during the definition
of an array and when using an array. Again, it&#39;s brackets in both places, but
they have different meanings. In this case, one use means <em>define</em> and the other
means <em>access</em>.
</aside></p>

<h4>Tinker with Arrays</h4>

<ul>
<li>Create an array with more/fewer items</li>
<li>What happens when you access something in a slot that doesn&#39;t exist?</li>
<li>How to you change one of the items in the array?</li>
<li>Figure out how many items are in an array using the <em>length</em> property</li>
<li>What happens when you <code>console.log</code> an array?</li>
<li>What else can you try?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Back to Fruit Shopping</h3>

<p>So we have an array, now let&#39;s work with it.</p>

<p><aside class="objective">
<strong>Keeping Track of Fruit</strong>
Create a function that will print out fruits needs purchasing. The fruits
will be stored in an array. Create another function that will print out that
the fruits have been purchased.
</aside></p>

<p>The goal is basically to call <code>startIndicatingFruitThatNeedsPurchasing</code>
with our array and get a result of:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">I need to purchase apples.
I need to purchase oranges.
I need to purchase bananas.</code></pre></div>

<p>Let&#39;s model this off of how we counted. We&#39;ll follow the same basic
steps to build up to a our function that is able to indicate
fruit that needs purchasing.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll do this first part together.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<ul>
<li>Create a <code>startIndicatingFruitPurchased</code> function.</li>
<li>Think about and discuss where things are being repeated in the code</li>
</ul>
