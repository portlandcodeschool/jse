  <p>This lesson will expand on some of the ideas we touched on while discussing
functions, but first we&#39;re going to add Git and Test Driven Development to our
workflow.</p>

<h2>Git &amp; GitHub</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s a typical workflow with GitHub:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a fork (GitHub)</li>
<li>Clone the fork (<code>git</code>)</li>
<li>Create a branch (<code>git</code>)</li>
<li>Review changes (<code>git</code>)</li>
<li>Commit changes (<code>git</code>)</li>
<li>Push changes (<code>git</code>)</li>
<li>Create pull request (GitHub)</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, we start and end on GitHub, but much of the time you&#39;ll be
using <code>git</code> on your computer. Let&#39;s take a look at this workflow.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone git@github.com:github_username/repo_name.git
cd repo_name

git checkout -b branch-name master

# do some work

git status
git diff

git add .
git commit -m &#39;My commit message.&#39;

git push origin branch-name</code></pre></div>

<p>Let&#39;s practice using Git and GitHub with <a href="https://github.com/portlandcodeschool/jsi-members">this repository</a>.</p>

<h3>Creating your own fork</h3>

<p>Fork of the GitHub, then:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git push git@github.com:my_github_username/repo_name.git branch-name

git remote add mine git@github.com:my_github_username/repo_name.git
git push mine branch-name

git push --set-upstream mine branch-name</code></pre></div>

<h3>Merging &amp; Conflicts</h3>

<p>When collaborating, you&#39;ll sometimes end up editing the same code as someone
else. The best way to understand this is to experience it in action.</p>

<p>Assuming you still are on a branch, the following will be pretty close do what
you&#39;ll want to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fetch and merge changes from upstream (<code>pull</code>)</li>
<li>Manually merge any conflicting files</li>
<li>Review changes</li>
<li>Commit</li>
<li>Push</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git pull origin master

git diff --ours
git diff --theirs
git add path/to/file/that/was/merged
git commit -m &#39;Merged changes from wherever.&#39;
git push origin branch-name</code></pre></div>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3407920/98069">This answer on StackOverflow</a> may also provide some guidance
if you get stuck merging.</p>

<p><aside>
<strong>Whitespace</strong></p>

<p>Whitespace, that is line breaks, spaces, and tabs, can cause headaches when
merging changes. You should make sure that when you commit changes that you
(or your text editor) hasn&#39;t changed whitespace in parts of the code that you
didn&#39;t intend to edit.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s a good idea to ensure that every file ends with a line break
(newline). Why? Many (command line) tools don&#39;t work quite as nicely when you
don&#39;t have that final newline. Git, for instance, will show you a weird
representation of changes that affect the addition/removal of content at the
end of a file if you don&#39;t have a trailing newline.
</aside></p>

<h3>Updating Course Contents</h3>

<p>Now that you know the typical Git workflow, you can actually make changes to
<a href="https://github.com/portlandcodeschool/jsi">this course</a> if you find any mistakes.</p>

<h3>Always Use Version Control</h3>

<p>Yes, this gets its own section. You know the basics of how to use <code>git</code>. You&#39;ll
keep getting better as you use it, and it won&#39;t slow you down. What will slow
you down is when you lose work you&#39;ve done or get your code into a weird state.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, you should commit code frequently. How frequently? It&#39;s
difficult to commit too frequently, but easy to not commit frequently enough.
One line commits are okay. You&#39;ll find them all over GitHub. Your commit should
probably change something. Once a day is too infrequently.</p>

<p>Generally, you&#39;ll want to commit <em>working code</em>, but there are times when it
may make sense to commit things that don&#39;t run. If, for instance, you want to
share progress with someone else, you may want to commit something that&#39;s
broken. It&#39;s generally a good idea to do this on a branch and share that branch
with someone else.</p>

<h2>Test Driven Development</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s use TDD to write an interest calculator.</p>

<p><aside class="objective">
<strong>Interest Calculator Objective</strong>
Write an continuous compounding interest calculator following the test driven
development workflow. The function should return just the interest, not the
amount owed.
</aside></p>

<p>Start with a test:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">describe(&#39;calculateInterest()&#39;, function() {
  it(&#39;fill me in&#39;, function() {
    // fill me in
  });
});</code></pre></div>

<p>Let&#39;s come up with some more tests. Remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test expected usage</li>
<li>Test corner cases</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenge</h3>

<p>Fork the repository <a href="https://github.com/portlandcodeschool/jsi-gravity">here</a>, follow the directions in the
<a href="https://github.com/portlandcodeschool/jsi-gravity/blob/master/README.md">README</a>, use TDD to create a solution, then create
a pull request with the solution.</p>

<p>The project uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.org">npm</a> to install <a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">Mocha</a> and <a href="http://chaijs.com">Chai</a>, so when
you first clone it, you should run <code>npm install</code>. You should run the tests you
write with <code>npm test</code> instead of using <code>node</code>.</p>

<p><aside>
<strong><code>npm install</code> and <code>npm test</code></strong></p>

<p>We&#39;re skipping over a few details here on how things are set up. Don&#39;t worry,
we&#39;ll be discussing this shortly when we introduce modules.
</aside></p>

<h2>More Fun With Functions</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s continue from where we left of with our fruit functions.</p>

<p>We were repeating ourselves quite a bit, so let&#39;s try to get rid of that
repetition. Identifying and repeated code, and creating a singular function or
piece of code that can be shared is called <em>abstraction</em>.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<ul>
<li>Write a function that takes an array of people as an argument an updates each
of their ages to be one year older. Make sure you write tests before you
write the function so you&#39;re properly doing TDD.</li>
<li>Write test for the <code>each</code> function.</li>
<li>Create a new version of the interest rate calculator that calculates the
amount of interest you&#39;ve paid with fluctuating interest rates. For example,
you may call <code>calculateInterest(1000, [0.041, 0.042, 0.38, 0.41], 1)</code> to
calculate the interest on $1000 over 1 year with 4 compounding periods. Note
that the formula for this is different.</li>
</ul>
