  <p>In this class we&#39;ll continue to discuss abstractions. We&#39;ll create some common
abstractions and group them together into <em>modules</em>. Finally, we&#39;ll focus on
clearly expressing what functions do while documenting code.</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>

<h3>Creating Modules</h3>

<p>Modules are created by placing code in a separate file. You can put whatever
code you want to in that file, but you can <em>expose</em> values and objects that
you want to through the <code>module.exports</code> object. All modules start with an
empty <code>module.exports</code> object, so you can add properties directly to that.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">/**
 * @file array-functions.js
 */

module.exports.each = function(array, fn) {
  // each function definition
};</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can directly set the <code>module.exports</code> object.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">/**
 * @file array-functions.js
 */

module.exports = {
  each: function(array, fn) {
    // each function definition
  }
};</code></pre></div>

<p>These two methods for exposing the <code>each</code> function are identical.</p>

<h4>Quick Status Check</h4>

<ul>
<li>Create a new module that exports the <code>each</code> function that we wrote last class</li>
<li>Expose a new function from this module called <code>sayHello</code> that simply logs
<code>&quot;hello world&quot;</code>. (You&#39;ll probably choose to delete this later.)</li>
<li>Expose a new property from this module called <code>version</code> that indicates the
version of this module&#39;s code (call it 0.1.0 for now).</li>
<li>Try switching to the other method of exposing information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using Modules</h3>

<p>In order to use a module, you use <code>require</code> to access the values that it has
exposed. You pass <code>require</code> one argument, a string that allows it to find the
module. For now we&#39;re going to be using a relative path, but we&#39;ll later see
other uses.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">/**
 * @file app.js
 */

var arrayFunctions = require(&#39;./array-functions&#39;);
var fruits = [&#39;kiwi&#39;, &#39;strawberry&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;];

arrayFunctions.each(fruits, function(fruit) {
  addFruitToSmoothie(fruit);
});</code></pre></div>

<p><aside>
<strong>Isn&#39;t this just complicating things more?</strong></p>

<p>At this point, it may feel forced to be splitting up our code into two files.
We&#39;re trying to develop some good habits early, though. Soon you&#39;ll be writing
hundreds (and even thousands) of lines of code. Learning when and how to
modularize your code base is an extremely important skill to develop.</p>

<p>This is where programming becomes more of an art than a science. There&#39;s no
formula or recipe to follow to know how to break up large code bases. There are
common patterns that people follow, and we&#39;ll discuss those, but many projects
do things differently. Practice and observation will improve your ability to
figure out good places to modularize.
</aside></p>

<h2>Documenting Code</h2>

<p>What does this function do?</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">module.exports.map = function(array, fn) {
  // map function definition
};</code></pre></div>

<p>Well maybe if I saw it used, it would make more sense, right?</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">console.log(arrayFunctions.map([1,2,4,5,6,7], function(a) {
  return a * a;
}));</code></pre></div>

<p>You may be able to guess (especially if you&#39;ve done some programming in other
languages before), but you also may not be able to. Knowing that the result may
help as well, but it&#39;s still a lot of work to try to figure things out this
way.</p>

<p>Even if you can guess from the code and the result, would you feel comfortable
writing code that used this <code>map</code> function? What if someone else wrote it and
decides to change how it works ever so slightly? They never told you how it
works, so why can&#39;t they change it?</p>

<p>When you write modules or any code that someone else will be building off of,
for that matter, you should document it.</p>

<p>An example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">/**
 * Create a new array by applying `fn` to each element in `array`
 * and using each result as the items of the new array.
 *
 * @function
 * @param {array} array - Input array
 * @param {function} fn - Mapping function
 * @returns {function} A new array
 * @example
 *
 * // create an array of squares
 * map([1,2,3], function(n) {
 *   return n * n;
 * });
 * //=&gt; [1, 4, 9]
 *
 * @example
 *
 * // make all words plural (simple logic)
 * var pluralize = function(word) {
 *   return word + &#39;s&#39;;
 * }
 * map([&#39;dog&#39;,&#39;cat&#39;], pluralize);
 * //=&gt; [&#39;dogs&#39;, &#39;cats&#39;]
 *
 */
var map = function() {
  // map function definition
};</code></pre></div>

<p>This specific format is used so that we can use <a href="http://usejsdoc.org">JSDoc</a> to create web
pages that we can share with others. Even if you don&#39;t plan on publishing the
documentation, it can&#39;t hurt to follow a rigid structure like this. It really
makes you think about how your functions should work. Running this code through
JSDoc makes it even easier to understand the function:</p>

<iframe src="/jsdoc-example/global.html" width="100%"></iframe>

<p>A list of the types in JavaScript that you can use to document your parameter
types can be found in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof"><code>typeof</code> documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>All of these challenges should be completed by writing code in a module. You
should use test driven development and git as well. Issue a pull request for
each challenge you complete on <a href="https://github.com/portlandcodeschool/jsi-modules">this repo</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement a <code>map</code> function. Be sure to use test driven development.</li>
<li>Alter the <code>each</code> function to give two arguments to the iteration function,
the object (as was already done), and the index of the object. For instance:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">each([&#39;table&#39;, &#39;chair&#39;], function(object, index) {
  console.log(&#39;The &#39; + object + &#39; is at index &#39; + index);
});</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Implement a <code>times</code> function that simply calls a function a given number of
times. For instance:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">times(5, function(n) {
  console.log(&#39;This has been called &#39; + n + &#39; time(s).&#39;);
});</code></pre></div>

<h2>Command line apps</h2>

<p>We&#39;ve been using command line apps since day one. Now we&#39;re going to make one
of our own.</p>

<p>First, let&#39;s take a look at how these apps commonly work. Run</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">npm install -g mocha
mocha -h</code></pre></div>

<p>We just used two command line apps, <code>npm</code> and <code>mocha</code>. Seeing the help for
Mocha should give you a pretty good idea of how command line apps typically
work. Usually they take arguments and use those arguments to figure out what
to do.</p>

<p>So what if we wanted to make a weather app?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Usage: weather [options] [location]

Options:

  -h, --help                      output usage information
  -V, --version                   output the version number
  -c, --celsius       show temperature in celsius
  -f, --fahrenheit   show temperature in fahrenheit
</code></pre></div>
<p>So our app needs to be able to handle getting help, the version, Celsius, and
fahrenheit. It also needs to allow a location to be specified. Let&#39;s get to
work.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">// weather.js, run with node weather.js

console.log(process.argv);</code></pre></div>

<p>We&#39;re on the right track, but when we run <code>mocha</code>, we don&#39;t have to run <code>node</code>,
we simply run <code>mocha</code>. Let&#39;s get that working:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mv weather.js weather
chmod +x weather</code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log(process.argv);</code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">./weather</code></pre></div>

<p>So what&#39;s all that? We made an <em>executable</em> file without a JavaScript
extension. We added a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)"><em>shebang</em></a> at the top of the file. The shebang
indicates to the system that how to run the program. We&#39;re telling it to use
<code>node</code>. Finally, we can now run our app via <code>./weather</code>. We can&#39;t simply run
<code>weather</code> because the computer doesn&#39;t usually search the current working
directory for programs to execute, so we instruct it to run by specifying
a relative path.</p>

<p><aside>
<strong>Shebang</strong></p>

<p>The shebang is actually ignored by the Node interpreter when it&#39;s run. So you
can also run <code>node weather</code> and it will work. The <code>#!</code> is the actual shebang.
The remaining part is the program to run instead of executing the file
directly. In this case, we&#39;re using the <code>env</code> command to look up the <code>node</code>
that the user prefers. To really understand how this all works, you could
consider doing the advanced project below, reimplementing <code>which</code>.
</aside></p>

<p>Here&#39;s how we could handle arguments:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">var celsius = false;
var fahrenheit = false;
var location = null;

each(process.argv.slice(2), function(arg) {
  switch (arg) {
    case &#39;-h&#39;:
    case &#39;--help&#39;:
      console.log(&quot;Here&#39;s some help...&quot;);
      process.exit(0);
      break;
    case &#39;-V&#39;:
    case &#39;--version&#39;:
      console.log(&#39;weather 0.1.0&#39;);
      process.exit(0);
      break;
    case &#39;-f&#39;:
    case &#39;--fahrenheit&#39;:
      fahrenheit = true;
      break;
    case &#39;-c&#39;:
    case &#39;--celsius&#39;:
      celsius = true;
      break;
    default:
      location = arg;
      break;
  }
});

if (!celsius &amp;&amp; !fahrenheit) {
  fahrenheit = true;
}

if (!location) {
  location = &#39;Portland, OR&#39;;
}

console.log(&#39;The weather in %s is hopefully sunny.&#39;, location);
if (fahrenheit) {
  console.log(&#39;The temperature is 70 fahrenheit.&#39;);
}
if (celsius) {
  console.log(&#39;The temperature is 21 Celsius.&#39;)
}</code></pre></div>

<p>Well that&#39;s a lot of code, it doesn&#39;t handle everything perfectly, and I&#39;m
certain that someone else out there has solved this same problem&hellip;</p>

<p>Is there a module for this?</p>

<h2>NPM</h2>

<p><code>npm</code> is Node&#39;s package manager. It&#39;s a command line tool that will allow us to
easily install and manage different modules. Its <a href="https://www.npmjs.org">website</a> is also
incredibly useful for searching for modules. Let&#39;s look for a <em>command line</em>
module.</p>

<p>And guess what? There <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/commander">is one</a>!</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s use it.</p>

<p><aside>
<strong>Popularity</strong></p>

<p>Note that popularity is a pretty good indicator of whether or not you may want
to consider using a module. You should also check to see how many open &amp;
close issues a project has as well as how long it&#39;s been since the project has
been worked on.</p>

<p><strong>Licenses</strong></p>

<p>Most projects on npm are hosted on GitHub and are licensed under the MIT open
source license. This may not always be the case. Be respectful of the license
under which a project is released. Generally, you&#39;ll be safe to use projects
off of npm without worrying about the license (the author published to npm
after all). If you&#39;re looking at a project for ideas in your own project,
though, you should look at the license before you take any ideas or code from
it. If copying code, you almost always have to credit the author regardless of
license.
</aside></p>

<h3>Setting Up a Project</h3>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
echo &quot;node_modules&quot; &gt; .gitignore
npm init
git add .
git ci -m &#39;Setting up project.&#39;</code></pre></div>

<h4>Installing Modules</h4>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">npm install --save commander</code></pre></div>

<p>You&#39;ll note that in your project directory you have a folder called
<code>node_modules</code> as well as a file called <code>package.json</code>. <code>npm</code> is using these to
manage the modules you&#39;re working with. The <code>--save</code> option indicated that you
wanted to save <code>commander</code> as an entry in your <code>package.json</code> file. Using the
<code>package.json</code> file, <code>npm</code> can easily re-create the list of packages you&#39;ve
installed on other machines with a simple <code>npm install</code>. This makes
collaboration (and deployment) much easier.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s update our weather app to use Commander.js instead of the custom code
that we wrote.</p>

<p><aside>
<strong>Red Flag: Code Duplication</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;ve duplicated the version number now in both the npm information as well as
in the <code>weather.js</code> file. Duplication leads to problems down the line as
you&#39;ll likely forget to make changes to every place that uses that duplicate
piece of information. We&#39;ll later learn how we can avoid this duplication.
</aside></p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>These projects are intentionally vague. You&#39;ll have to discuss how the user
will interact with your app and arguments they will pass to your app to make it
do what they want. Don&#39;t forget to continue to use TDD. Also, you should set
up a repository on GitHub for this small project to allow easy collaboration
while pair programming.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a calculator</li>
<li>Write an app where the user needs to find his/her way through a maze</li>
<li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Write your own version of the <code>which</code> command. This challenge
will require you to learn a little about how Unix indicates that files are
<em>executable</em> as well as <em>environment variables</em> and what the <em>user&#39;s path</em>
means. Read <code>man which</code> for details on how this program works, and please
indicate that you&#39;re trying to tackle this problem so we can chat about a few
things first.</li>
</ul>
