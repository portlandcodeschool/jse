  <p>TODO: The repository that&#39;s linked to for the <code>map</code> function is not set up at
all. It should be set up to at least have Travis working with it, but maybe
with JSHint as well.</p>

<h2>Class Flow</h2>

<h2>- Run through slides</h2>

<ul>
<li>When you get to the command line apps and handling arguments, the students
should read through the code first. This will be their first exercise in
reading longer code and/or a code base that they didn&#39;t write. Explain that
they should try to figure things out, maybe even get it running and see what
different pieces do by logging.
The first new piece here will be the slice call on <code>process.argv</code>. Make sure
they understand that after reading it.
It also involves a switch statement which they haven&#39;t seen before. See if
they can figure out what this does on their own. Allow them to discuss with a
partner and search the Internet. Give them a few minutes to do this, then
explain switch statements, fall-through cases, and show them the equivalent
if/else structure.
Also, this is the first time that <code>%s</code> has been used in a string instead of
concatenating with <code>+</code>. Be sure to point that out.</li>
</ul>
