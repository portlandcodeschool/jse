  <p>Allowing uses to sign up and log into your website is a complicated process.
It&#39;s gotten more complicated recently for developers as many sites are allowing
people to log in using Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>HTTP wasn&#39;t designed to deliver custom content on a per-user basis. It was
designed to allow hundreds of thousands of requests to be made to a server
without overloading the server.</p>

<p>What&#39;s that mean?</p>

<p>It means they designed it to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol"><em>stateless</em></a>. By state, we mean
that each request is independent of another. If I make a request to a web
server, the web server will handle the HTTP request and give me a response. It
will immediately forget that ever happened. When I make another request, it
will handle that as well, but won&#39;t have any knowledge of prior requests.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is only a limitation of HTTP &mdash; We&#39;re able to work around
this (otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be able to log into any sites).</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p>There are a few things we can use to our advantage to remember users as they
continue to make requests to our web applications. We&#39;ll be solving these
problems at the application level, above HTTP. We&#39;ll use features of HTTP to
achieve this, but it wouldn&#39;t be possible without the application handling some
of the work.</p>

<h3>HTTP Headers</h3>

<p>We haven&#39;t really discussed HTTP in detail up until now. The best way to
understand HTTP is to see it in action, so let&#39;s do just that.</p>

<p>Run the <em>netcat</em> tool:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">nc -l 9000
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now open your browser and go to <code>http://localhost:9000/</code>. Your browser is
making an HTTP request to your computer on port <code>9000</code> and will continue to
wait for a response for a while. The command you ran is actually just listening
on port <code>9000</code> for anything that comes in. If you go look at it, you can see
the request that your web browser issued.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s respond.</p>

<p>Type whatever you want to followed by a newline, then &#8963;D (which tells
<code>nc</code> you&#39;re finished with this transmission). Try responding with some HTML and
see what happens.</p>

<p>A proper response is specifically formatted. This is what node&#39;s <code>http</code> module
does when you create a server. Let&#39;s give a proper response now. You could type
this in manually, but we&#39;ll do it a little differently to avoid quite as much
copying and pasting.</p>

<p>Create a new directory to work in, and <code>cd</code> to it. Create a file called
<code>index.html</code> with some HTML in it. Also create a file, <code>index.headers</code> with the
following content (make sure you have two blank lines at the bottom of your file):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now run <code>cat index.headers index.html</code> and make sure there&#39;s at least one
blank line between your headers and your HTML. Once you&#39;ve got that, run
<code>cat index.headers index.html | nc -l 9000</code> and access your page in the
browser.</p>

<p>Use Chrome&#39;s developer tools to view the HTTP response headers. Try adding a
custom HTTP header to your response. What happens if you change the content
type so it&#39;s XML instead of HTML?</p>

<p><aside>
<strong>HTTP Keep-Alive</strong></p>

<p>Run <code>nc -kl 9000</code> which keeps netcat running after you respond (it will wait
for the server to close the connection). Play around with sending responses to
your browser this way.</p>

<p>HTTP Keep-Alive allows a browser to keep a connection to a server and issue
multiple HTTP requests over one TCP connection. This optimization improves
performance.
</aside></p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>

<p>Use <em>netcat</em> to respond to an HTTP request and display an image to the browser.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are little bits of data that are stored by web browsers. Any time a
request is made to a server, the browser will look for any cookies it stored
that are associated with that server and send the cookie data along with the
request.</p>

<p>Either the client or the server can set cookies.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clients set cookies via JavaScript</li>
<li>Servers set cookies via HTTP headers</li>
<li>Browsers transmit cookies via HTTP headers</li>
</ul>

<p>Your server side application can use cookies to track users over multiple
requests.</p>

<p><aside>
<strong>HTTP Only Cookies</strong></p>

<p>HTTP only cookies cannot be read by JavaScript. They&#39;re transmitted to the,
browser, the browser stores them, and will send them back in future requests to
the server, but the browser will not make them available to your client side
JavaScript.</p>

<p>This helps prevent cookie theft and session hijacking via cross site scripting
attacks.</p>

<p>Most browsers support this feature, but older browsers did not have it. On
these older browsers, HTTP only cookies will still be accessible to JavaScript.</p>

<p><strong>Secure Cookies</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s possible for servers to send <em>secure</em> cookies. Most of the time, that
doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t be read by users on the client end. Even if you
look at them and you don&#39;t think they seem readable, they could simply be
encoded (base64 is a common choice here).</p>

<p>Never store sensitive data in cookies. If you need to store sensitive data
that and associate it with someone using your site, use database backed
sessions and store the data on the server.
</aside></p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>

<p>Create an application that uses cookies on the client and server sides. Your
client side page should be served by the server (rather than loaded via the
<code>file://</code> protocol).</p>

<p>The server side should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log cookies for all incoming requests</li>
<li>Create a cookie, <code>last-request-time</code></li>
<li>Log a message like <code>last access by user: 10s ago</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The client side should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have an input that allows the user to enter their favorite color</li>
<li>When the user enters their favorite color, store it in a cookie,
<code>favorite-color</code>, remove the input and display the favorite color as well as
an edit button.</li>
<li>Subsequent access to the page should not show the input if the favorite color
is already known.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Security is a serious concern when dealing with authentication. As a web
developer, you should arm yourself with as much security knowledge as you can.
We&#39;ll get to more later, but for now we&#39;ll hit some basics.</p>

<h3>SSL/TLS</h3>

<p>Requests sent via HTTP are not secure. It means that everything is plain text.
Try this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ nc -l 9000</code></pre></div>

<p>Now login here (don&#39;t use a real password):</p>

<form class="auth" action="http://localhost:9000" method="post">
<input name="username" placeholder="Username">
<input name="password" placeholder="Password">
<button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>

<p>Go back to your terminal and see what shows up. See what happens when
you <a id="secure-form" href="#">make it secure</a>.</p>

<script>
$(function() {
  $('a#secure-form').click(function() {
    $('form.auth').attr('action', 'https://localhost:9000');
    $('form.auth button').text('Secure Login');
    $(this).remove();
    return false;
  });
});
</script>

<p>Attackers can eavesdrop on HTTP traffic that isn&#39;t secured by TLS/SSL. We can&#39;t
transmit passwords, authentication tokens, credit card, bank account, or other
confidential information over a connection that isn&#39;t secure.</p>

<p><aside>
We&#39;ll touch on security a little more in the future, but be aware that you
won&#39;t get everything right if you try to implement login on your own. You just
don&#39;t know enough. And that won&#39;t change. This isn&#39;t something you want to take
a risk on doing on your own. You want to trust the modules that others have
built, been peer reviewed, and been vetted over time.
</aside></p>

<h2>Middleware</h2>

<p>Much of what we&#39;ve discussed is very easy to do with Express. Express is built
to easily include <em>middleware</em>, pre-packaged modules that can run before (or
after) your application code and reduce the work you need to do. Here are some
useful middleware modules:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser"><code>cookie-parser</code></a> for basic cookie handling</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/expressjs/session"><code>express-session</code></a> for sessions persisted server side</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-session"><code>cookie-session</code></a> for sessions persisted in cookies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Putting it All Together</h2>

<p>Once you understand cookies and the security issues behind authentication, you
can start to build up an authentication, authorization, and user management
system.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/wbyoung/node-basic-auth-examples"><code>node-basic-auth-examples</code></a> project
<a href="http://node-basic-auth-examples.herokuapp.com">demonstrates</a> cookie based authentication as well as
token based authentication via HTTP headers.</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>

<p><strong>Advanced:</strong> Update the authentication example to persist users and sessions.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p><em>Authentication</em> is what we think of as the login process. Usually we
authenticate with a web applications by providing a username and password.</p>

<p><em>Authorization</em> is the process of determining what a user is a allowed to do.
Can the currently authenticated user create posts? Can they delete users?</p>

<h2>More</h2>

<p>Cookies are a good way to handle associating an authenticated user with a
request, but they only work when a browser is in place.</p>

<p>APIs typically use tokens to determine the user who&#39;s making the request and
<em>authorize</em> that they have access to access the requested resource of perform
the requested action. These tokens are usually returned by the API after the
initial authentication, then passed via a HTTP header for all subsequent
requests that require authorization.</p>

<h3>OAuth</h3>

<p>OAuth is a popular standard for authentication that&#39;s widely used. It&#39;s usually
the system that you use when you log into a site using your Google, Twitter,
Facebook, or whatever account.</p>

<p>It also supports scenarios for API authorization. Applications that wish to
make use of many modern APIs authenticate via OAuth, then pass authorization
tokens for each API call.</p>

<p>Google does a pretty good job documenting OAuth for
<a href="https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2Login">authentication (login)</a> and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2">authorization (API access)</a>.</p>

<h3>Passport</h3>

<p><a href="http://passportjs.org">Passport</a> is a Node.js module that allows you to easily support many
different authentication strategies (including pretty much every popular social
media site you could imagine).</p>
