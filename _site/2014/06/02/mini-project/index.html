  <p>Over the following week, we&#39;re going to create a portfolio site that you can
use to showcase your work. We&#39;ll publish this to GitHub Pages and optionally
tie it to a custom domain name.</p>

<p>During this process, we&#39;re going to create a tool to make building small,
static websites easier.</p>

<h2>Static Site Generator</h2>

<p>Static site generators are tools that allow you to build websites by reusing
components. This allows you to more easily share your general site layout
across pages or specific parts of your page like a navigation bar. There are
many static site generation tools that exist today. <a href="http://wintersmith.io">And</a>
<a href="http://assemble.io">I</a> <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">really</a> <a href="http://middlemanapp.com">mean</a> <a href="http://nanoc.ws">a</a>
<a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/02/list-static-website-generators.html">lot</a>.</p>

<p>These tools process a set of files in various formats, usually in a very rigid
directory structure, and generate a website that is composed of simple HTML,
CSS, etc.</p>

<p>Each team is tasked with building their own generator. Over the course of the
project, we will touch on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project scope and specifications</li>
<li>System design</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Publishing projects</li>
<li>Continuous integration</li>
</ul>

<p>Approach this project as if your new boss has tasked you with building the next
great static site generator. She wants you to build something that&#39;s better
than everything else that&#39;s already out there, but that&#39;s all she&#39;s said at
this point.</p>

<h2>Before We Begin</h2>

<p>Before we dive too deeply into building this tool, let&#39;s make sure we have a
site that we&#39;ll use the generator to build and publish.</p>

<p>Each student should build a simple web site with plain HTML and CSS with a few
links between pages. To make your site slightly more attractive quickly, you
should use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>. Collaborate with your team as you build your
site, but everyone&#39;s site will be unique. How unique is up to you.</p>

<p>Discuss what you want to be on your portfolio site and how you want to break
down the content across pages.</p>
