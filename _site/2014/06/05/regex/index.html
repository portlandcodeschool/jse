  <p>Regular expressions are one of the most useful tools you&#39;ll add to your
toolbelt. They allow you to search for patterns in text and operate on the
search results.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they&#39;re cryptic. They require you to invest some time learning
how to use them before you get any sort of productivity payoff.</p>

<p>Once you master them, you&#39;ll find them infinitely useful and wish that every
application that you used supported search via regular expressions.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>These resources are presented in no particular order. You will certainly have
some questions when you start digging into this material.</p>

<p>A learning tip: you will not learn regular expressions simply by reading about
them. You&#39;ll have to try them out and come up with ways to use them.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions">MDN on Regular Expressions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Wikipedia on Regular Expressions</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.regexper.com/">Display Regualr Expressions</a></li>
<li><a href="http://regexpal.com/">Regex Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://regexone.com/">RegexOne</a><br>
A site that teaches regular expressions and gives small tests during the
learning process.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info">Regular Expression Tutorial</a><br>
This site has been around for a while and is still a good tutorial. You can
use Sublime Text to test your regular expressions.</li>
<li><a href="http://qntm.org/files/re/re.html">Learn regular expressions in about 55 minutes</a><br>
This site aims to introduce regular expressions quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Challenges like <a href="http://regex.alf.nu">Regex Golf</a> and <a href="http://callumacrae.github.io/regex-tuesday/">Regex Tuesday</a>
are a great ways to test your knowledge and improve your skills. These quickly
get hard, so you&#39;ll want to hold off until you&#39;re needing a challenge.</p>

<h2>Mastering Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>Remember when you first learned to type? You probably typed via
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing#Hunt_and_peck">hunt and peck</a> until someone told you to stop that. (Are you
still a hunt and peck typer? <em>Stop that!</em>) It was hard at first. You made
mistakes, and you were slower. You really wanted to go back to your old ways.
But eventually you were far more productive, right?</p>

<p>Do the same with regular expressions. When you&#39;re in your using your text
editor and realize that you&#39;re searching for something that a regex could make
easier, write the regex. It may take you twice as long, but every one you write
will make you better.</p>

<p>Eventually, you&#39;ll be able to save the day with your new found knowledge.</p>
