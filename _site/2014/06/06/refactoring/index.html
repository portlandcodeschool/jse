  <p>By now you&#39;ve written a good amount of code. You&#39;ve probably ended up with a
jumbly mess at times. Here&#39;s what happens when you leave it that way:</p>

<p><a href="http://abstrusegoose.com/432"><img src="http://abstrusegoose.com/strips/you_down_wit_OPC-yeah_you_know_me.png" alt="Comic"></a> <small><a href="https://twitter.com/brittanytarvin/status/452838810141732865">via @britanytarvin</a></small></p>

<p>This applies both to other people reading your code as well as when you come
back to read your code a few weeks/months/years later.</p>

<h2>Why Do Programming Languages Exist?</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s get a few things straight. Programmers don&#39;t think like computers. They
don&#39;t solve problems like computers. No points are awarded for terseness of the
code you write. You get points for clearly expressing your intent. You get
extra points when you make it really easy for other people to understand.</p>

<p>Programming languages exist to allow clear expression of intent, to communicate
ideas to to other human beings. They just so happen to drive computers as well.
The computer doesn&#39;t care if you tell it <code>0010101110101010100101010110111</code>. But
a human does.</p>

<p>Once your code works, you may not be finished writing it. You need to make sure
it&#39;s clear.</p>

<h2>Refactoring</h2>

<p>Refactoring is the process of reorganizing code so that it&#39;s more clear and/or
less complex without changing how it works.</p>

<p>There are entire books written on refactoring. Wikipedia has a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">decent page</a> discussing refactoring. It goes into some techniques
that you could apply.</p>

<p>The truth is, clearly written code is an art form. You&#39;ll better understand how
to write good code as you spend time reading other people&#39;s code. You&#39;ll learn
from the good code you read. You&#39;ll learn from the bad. You&#39;ll learn from
yourself when you go back to code you wrote a year ago (this will continue for
as long as you&#39;re a programmer).</p>

<p>One of the best ways to tell if what you wrote is clear is to explain it to
someone else. Pair programming helps with this a lot. Writing something on your
own? Explain it to a stuffed animal. Seriously.</p>
