You may find some of these resources to be useful companion materials while
learning JavaScript.

## Sites

* [Mozilla Developer Network][mdn]  
  Mozilla has done a great job documenting many of the tools needed to build
  websites. Their documentation on JavaScript, in particular is great.

* [WebPlatform][webplatform]  
  Joint project by many organizations to do a better job documenting HTML, CSS,
  JavaScript, etc. This is still a work in progress, but it's pretty good for
  CSS. In particular, you should use this over W3Schools (which some people
  even recommend you avoid by always adding `-w3schools` to your searches).

* [nodeschool.io][nodeschool]  
  Great lessons to learn Node.js.

* [SlowmoJS][slowmojs] and [metajs][metajs]  
  Sites for visualizing code flow.

* [Can I Use&hellip;][caniuse]  
  This site will tell you whether a browser includes certain functionality and
  will allow you to quickly choose whether you should use that feature or not.


## Articles

* [How browsers work][browsers]
* [Impostor Syndrome][impostor]

## Presentations

Here is some advice on finding jobs in the Portland tech industry and shaping your resume from Brad Goettemoeller, a recruiter with VanderHouwen & Associates:

- [Resumes 101]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/PortlandCodeSchool2-resumes101.pdf)

## Tools

- [Node.js][node]  
- [npm][npm]  
- [JSHint][jshint]

## Online Books

* [Git Book][gitbook]  
  More than you ever wanted to know about Git.

* [JSbooks][jsbooks]  
  Free JavaScript books.


## Books

* _JavaScript: The Good Parts_, Douglas Crockford  
  Intermediate, $30  
  This is one of the top selling JavaScript books, and it contains good
  tidbits, gotchas, and opinions. Overall, it's not going to teach you
  JavaScript, but it will explain why some JavaScript developers write code
  in a specific way.

* _Effective JavaScript_, David Herman  
  Intermediate, $20  
  This is a good book to teach you some finer points of JavaScript, how things
  work, which language features to use, and which to avoid.
