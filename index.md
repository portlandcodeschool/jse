### What is this course?
- [description on PCS site](http://www.portlandcodeschool.com/javascript/)

### Weekly Flow: 
- Most assignments will be assigned on a Monday and finished by the following Monday.
- Reading is listed on the day it is due, with the exception of the first day of class. 

### Recommendations for a Good Experience
- Always ask for help before it's too late. We don't want you to get too far behind.
- Hack always. Hack means to "throw some code together", rather than "illegally break into things with code". You should be playing with code even when you are done with homework. Have fun. Find a side-project.
- Be social. Go to meetups. Get together with classmates. Come to office hours for help. 
- Learn to love frustration and problem-solving. Keep your head up and your attitude positive. If you are stuck for too long, "phone a friend".
